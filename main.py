    This function showcases the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern implementation

    - Tool registration and management
    - Agent prompt template configuration  
    - LLM integration with custom callbacks
    - Agent execution with intermediate step tracking
    
    The implementation serves as a foundation for more complex RAG applications
    involving grocery sales data and complementary datasets.

    Question: the input question you must answer
    Thought: you should always think about what to do
    Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
    Action Input: the input to the action
