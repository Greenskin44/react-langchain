## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is an educational project based on Eden Marco's Udemy Course on LangChain. If you discover a security vulnerability, please handle it responsibly:

### For Educational/Demo Purposes:
- This project is intended for learning and demonstration
- Not recommended for production use without proper security review
- Educational focus on LangChain concepts rather than production security

### Reporting Process:
1. **Do NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send details via email to the repository maintainer
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline:
- Initial response: Within 48 hours
- Vulnerability assessment: Within 1 week
- Fix timeline: Varies based on severity and educational impact

## Security Considerations

### API Keys and Secrets:
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files to version control
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in source code

### LangChain Security:
- Be cautious with custom tools that access external resources
- Validate all inputs to custom functions
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments
- Review LangChain security best practices

### Dependencies:
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

## Educational Security Notes

This project demonstrates:
- Proper environment variable usage
- Safe API key management
- Callback handler implementation
- Tool security patterns

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes and was completed as part of Eden Marco's Udemy Course on LangChain. It is not intended for production use without proper security review and hardening.

For production deployments:
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Conduct security testing
- Review all third-party dependencies
- Implement rate limiting and abuse protection
