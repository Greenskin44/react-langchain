# Contributing to React Agent with LangChain RAG

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this educational project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our ReAct agent implementation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a sophisticated ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent implementation using LangChain for ice breaker applications with RAG capabilities. It was created as part of Eden Marco's educational curriculum on LangChain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Git
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of LangChain and agent architectures

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-langchain.git
   cd react-langchain
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Using pipenv (recommended)
   pipenv install --dev
   pipenv shell
   
   # Or using pip
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use Black for code formatting: `black .`

### Project Structure

```
├── main.py              # Core agent implementation
├── callbacks.py         # Custom callback handlers
├── tests/              # Unit tests (future enhancement)
├── docs/               # Additional documentation
├── examples/           # Usage examples
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests

Example:
```
feat: add grocery sales data integration tool
fix: resolve callback handler formatting issue
docs: update installation instructions
```

## 🧪 Testing

Currently, this project focuses on educational demonstration. Future contributions should include:

- Unit tests for all custom tools
- Integration tests for agent workflows
- Callback handler testing
- End-to-end agent testing

## 📝 Documentation

When contributing:

1. Update README.md if adding new features
2. Add docstrings to all new functions/classes
3. Include usage examples for new tools
4. Update requirements.txt for new dependencies

## 🔧 Types of Contributions
